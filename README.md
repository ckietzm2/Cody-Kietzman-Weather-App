Cody Kietzman Weather App Challenge 6

The weather app takes in the city data from the user and displays the current weather and the 5 day forecast by taking data from the weather API.  I used the fetch command to get my data and then manipulated the data with a for loop.  When a user types in a city the city is then stored and a button is created with that city name on it.  The user can see what cities they previously searched.
